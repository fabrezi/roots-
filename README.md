# story

Software world is in a constant state of change. Every year, there are new programs, updates and related services. Many times, the newer programs are still solving older or known problems, such as: interactive UI, HTTP request etc. So why cant the old stack or prior programs tackle the same problems?

The old stack is a term I use to define the technology that gave birth or rise to many of the modern stacks.

Further, the roots project is based on software that is free and old. I believe there is much worth is these programs and the task is to find how to apply old tools to new problems.

The old stack is defined as follows:

- Assembly
- C
- HTML
- awk
<tbc>
